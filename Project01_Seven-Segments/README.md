# Goal
The goal of the project is to discorver programming with an easy example: the seven-segement display.

# Language
The code is written in Javascript with P5.js

# Code
You can see the page [here](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/117-seven-segment.html)

# How to proceed?
1. Watch the [video](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/117-seven-segment.html)
2. Try to understand the principle. The code is probably too obscur at this time.
3. Watch the video another time to understand what the code is doing globaly
4. Go to the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) of P5.js and watch the beginning
5. you can also access the manual of P5.js [here](https://p5js.org/reference/)
